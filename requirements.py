python 3.x
pip install tkinter

<h3>Check for Built-in Tkinter Package</h3>
  
As mentioned above, the Tkinter package also comes pre-installed with python 3.7 and higher. 
This essentially means that the user might not need to explicitly install the Tkinter package as it may already be installed on his machine.
To verify this, run the following command inside the Command Prompt:

python -m tkinter
